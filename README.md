# EuroCoins-DB
This is third third year project for our database management &amp; web programming related course.

## Warning: 

This database setup is wrong in regards of relationships setup. The primary/foreign key setup was not done proprely.

*i.e*: 
  P06_PieceModele is the one that should of been receiving P06_PiecePays & P06_PieceCaracteristique & P06_PieceTranche
  primary keys as foriegn keys and not the other way around.

This miss-conception was fixed in a later project that consisted of creating a simple web app using Symfony to interface
this database.
